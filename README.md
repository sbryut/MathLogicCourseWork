# Description
The repository contains a term paper on the discipline "Mathematical logic" of SPBSTU. The version presents both work options: with vertical gluing (level = HARD) and without gluing (level = EASY). Six types of restrictions are described. The results are output both to the console and to a file "out.txt".
To run the code, you need to install the library "Buddy".
